# Automatic Next Updates

After sending an update, you might want to trigger another update automatically, depending on the update and the resulting model.


## Examples

The [todomvc](https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples/tree/master/examples/todomvc), [todo-list](https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples/tree/master/examples/todo-list), and [rocket-laucher](https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples/tree/master/examples/rocket-launcher) examples use `nextUpdate` functions.
