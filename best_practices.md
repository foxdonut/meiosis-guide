# Best Practices

We'll discuss some best practices in this chapter, but please remember that Meiosis is designed to be flexible. The answer to _What is the best practice for..._ is usually "It depends." What works for one application may not be the best solution for another, depending on the context, requirements, and so on. This chapter contains patterns that you may find useful, but feel free to change and adapt to best suit your needs.
