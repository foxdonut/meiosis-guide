# Best Practices

Coming soon.

We'll discuss some best practices in this chapter, but please remember that Meiosis is designed to be flexible. The answer to _What is the best practice for..._ is usually "It depends." What works for one application may not be the best solution for another, depending on the context, requirements, and so on.
