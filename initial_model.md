# Initial Model

When you create a component, you can set its initial model with the `initialModel` property. Like all properties for `Meiosis.createComponent`, it is optional. If unspecified, an empty object, `{ }` is used as the default.

In respecting the *single model* principle, the initial models of all components are merged together into a root model.
